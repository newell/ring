# Ring Oscillator

A [ring oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_oscillator) is a type of electronic oscillator circuit used to generate continuous square wave signals. It is commonly used in digital systems, clock generation, and timing circuits. The ring oscillator derives its name from the ring-like configuration of its components.

The ring oscillator consists of an odd number of inverting stages connected in a loop. Here's a general description of the ring oscillator's operation:

1. **Inverting Stages**: The key components of a ring oscillator are inverting stages, typically implemented using inverters or amplifiers. Each inverting stage inverts the input signal and amplifies it before passing it to the next stage.

2. **Feedback Loop**: The output of the last inverting stage is connected back to the input of the first stage, creating a feedback loop. This loop causes the signal to circulate continuously through the inverting stages.

3. **Propagation Delay**: Each inverting stage introduces a certain propagation delay due to its internal circuitry. The cumulative effect of these delays results in a delay around the loop, which determines the oscillation frequency.

4. **Timing Components**: The timing components in a ring oscillator are primarily the inverting stages themselves. The number of stages and the characteristics of each stage (e.g., propagation delay) determine the frequency of oscillation.

When the ring oscillator is powered on, the signal circulates through the inverting stages repeatedly, resulting in a continuous oscillation of the output signal. The oscillation frequency is determined by the cumulative propagation delay of the inverting stages.

Ring oscillators are commonly used in digital systems for clock generation, synchronization, and timing purposes. Their square wave output makes them suitable for driving digital circuits and providing timing references.
